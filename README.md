# Computational-Physics
Albert Einstein group

We each create our own branch to work on (mine is called FlorianHollants_branch so maybe we should stick to the same naming scheme)
Workflow:
- On your local machine you switch to your own branch with git checkout branch_name
- From there you use git add . and git commit -m "write_your_commit_message_here" to commit that branch
- Use git push to push it onto the remote machine. (Make sure to regularly do that when finishing a work session, even if the code still doesn't work or you are not fully finished with it)
- When you are happy with the code and want to merge it, you create a pull request on GitHub. When you do that we will be able to comment on your code and see if there is anything we would still change, - or resolve any possible merge issues. Afterwards any of us can merge the pull request onto the main branch.


First time launch:
I would recommend taking the following steps after you were added to the Project:
- In your command line, go to the folder you want to save the Repository in (you dont need to create an extra folder, that will happen automatically)
- use git clone https://github.com/Flopsiturtle/Computational-Physics.git to clone the Repository onto your local machine
- use git checkout -b your_branch_name to create your own branch on your local machine
- go to the python file and in the code, add your Name next to mine at the top of the code and save the change.
- check that you are indeed on your own branch using git branch
- use git add. and git commit -m "message" to commit that change locally
- use git push -u origin your_branch_name to create your branch on GitHub and push the change
- Merge that change onto main just to see that everything works
