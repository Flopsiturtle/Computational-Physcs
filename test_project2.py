#Flo T ### test if inverse is correct

###### Tests:
#Flo T ## test if really eigenvalues/vectors
#Flo H ## test if really orthonormal
#Mickey ## test if really lowest eigenvalue
#xxx ## test our results with linalgs programs (?)

#Mickey/Flo H ## test with matrices we know eigenvalues/vectors -->> hamiltonians from different systems
### .....


### some kind of test for checking if chosen error and maxiters is good?    # e.g. test different errors and outcomes   

### also if program is run multiple times, is convergence the same? what error if not --> well depends on chosen error of course...
